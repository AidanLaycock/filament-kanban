## fix edit modal not receving record id after updating another model if a richtext is present - 2024-01-19

this was a weird one.

if you have a `RichText` in your form schema, and you update one of the records, the next time you click on a card the form won't receive the `recordId` in `getEditModalFormSchema`.

this fixes it.

hopefully not introducing any regression. i set the record id to `null` as a safety measure anyway.
