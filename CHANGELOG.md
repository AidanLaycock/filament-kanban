## hacky fix to the actual issue - 2024-01-19

the previous attempt at fixing the issue with form that have a rich editor in them wasn't addressing the actual issue.

the issue is that when you have a working rich editor in the form, sometimes the form schema is created before the click record action is handled, which makes the form use the obsolete `$editModalRecordId`.

the form didn't have an issue before adding `mount` with `$form->fill()` only because the rich editor was broken.
and when you fix it by adding the `mount` method, it starts messing up the flow. if you don't set the `$editModalRecordId` to null you might feel like you're avoiding some issues, but the form is using old `$editModalRecordId` for building schema.

here I've manually triggered a schema creation inside the click handler to fix the issue, but i don't like it.

would appreciate if you have better solutions.

## fix edit modal not receving record id after updating another model if a richtext is present - 2024-01-19

this was a weird one.

if you have a `RichText` in your form schema, and you update one of the records, the next time you click on a card the form won't receive the `recordId` in `getEditModalFormSchema`.

this fixes it.

hopefully not introducing any regression. i set the record id to `null` as a safety measure anyway.
